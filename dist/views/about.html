      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a full stack developer that's worked primarily doing front end
        development on a react native health tech app. I'm using this space
        online to write about code, what I am learning and what I am
        experimenting with. The main point of this is to get a better
        understanding of what I'm coding and be able to articulate the technical
        skills that I do have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a firm believer in continuous improvement and take time out daily to
        practice the language I write best in through leetcode and building my
        own projects.
      </p>
      <p>I write at medium here.</p>
      <p>
        My current goals are to contribute to open source and work full time on
        a software project.
